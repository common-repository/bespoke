The Bespoke plugin by Presscast allows you to recruit and connect experts to your audience real-time.

== Description ==

The [Bespoke](https://bespoke.app) plugin by offers you a new way to engage your audience while monetizing your content. As an influential voice in your field, domain experts bid to be connected with your audience via the Bespoke live chat plugin hosted on your site in order to answer their questions in an AMA-style (Ask Me Anything) format.

Before connecting your site with the chat feature, using the Bespoke plugin, you can enable a teaser banner on your site in order to gauge expert excitement. The banner contains a link which redirects interested visitors to the Bespoke waiting list. There, weâ€™ll collect some information about their interest in your site and let you know about any experts that seem like a good fit.

Have fun!
